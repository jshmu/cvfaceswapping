1. Run file klt_tracking.py in the root folder
2. Specify path names for videos you want to run the video for. 

Note: We did bakcwards KLT tracking for the Hard/Joker.mp4 video and hence the code is in a different script. (The weighted average algorithm remains the same). Please run klt_joker.py for getting results for Hard test video.

Results can be found here:
